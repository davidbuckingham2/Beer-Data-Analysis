# Beer Data Analysis with Python

This project showcases various data analysis skills using a dataset containing beer-related information and reviews. This is a summary of the skills used and insights gained from the project, but I highly enourage you to explore my Jupyter Notebook for more information. The main techniques and skills demonstrated include:

## Data Exploration and Cleaning

- **Data Loading:** The project begins with loading the dataset from a compressed file using pandas.
  
- **Data Exploration:** Initial exploration includes checking the dataset's structure, basic statistics, and identifying missing values.

- **Data Cleaning:** Null values are removed, ensuring data integrity and completeness for analysis.

- **Data Aggregation:** To find the best-rated beers, duplicates are removed to keep only the highest-rated review for each unique beer and reviewer combination.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

- **Brewery Ranking:** Breweries producing the strongest beers are ranked based on their Average Alcohol by Volume (ABV) content.

- **Best Year for Beers:** Determined which year had the highest-rated beers by aggregating yearly review data and calculating average ratings.

- **Correlation Analysis:** Assessed the correlation between different review aspects and overall review scores to identify the most important factors in user ratings.

- **Recommendation of Top Beers:** Explored the top-rated beers based on a combination of high review scores and a sufficient number of reviews.
